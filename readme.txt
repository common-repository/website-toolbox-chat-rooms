== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I don't allow registration on my WordPress site, can I still use the chat room? =

Yes. If you don't have registration enabled on your WordPress site, your users can register an account directly on the chat room. If you want users to be able to chat without registering, you can simply enable guest access on the chat room or you can disable the User Accounts feature entirely so users don't even see the registration option.
